# CCT-TEX Template

> The template really sucks.

## Image

First, convert the image to eps format, using the following command:

```bash
bmeps.exe -c image.[suffix] image.eps
```

## Tool

`CTex_2.8x_Full`

## Notes

Run `repair.exe` to config the path. Restart for several times. Use Administator to run the tool.

Don't convert files to UTF-8. Strange compilation errors would occur.
